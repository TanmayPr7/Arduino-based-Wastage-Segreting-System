# This is an Arduino based wastage segretion system project, which
uses microcontroller(Arduino), sensors, ledd's, servo, etc. It basaically
detects the moisture of the waste and seprates biodegradable and non-
biodegradable waste on the basis of moisture presence

# It basically uses moisture sensor which detects the moisture presence 
in paticullar waste material and seprate it on the basis of wet and dry
waste. It detects the moisture and sends the data to microcontroller(Arduino),
the Arduino works according to the program and seprates the wastage, if the 
moisture is lower or equal to the value fixed in program, it will consider
the waste as biodegradable waste and if moisture is higher or equal to the 
value fixed in program, it will consider the waste as non - biodegradable

# If the waste is considered as biodegradable it will turn on the green led
and turns the servo at 45 degree, and if waste is considered as non - biodegradable
it will turn on the red led and turns the servo at 135 degree. In this way our
project detects the moisture level and differentiate wastage into biodegradable or
non - biodegradable and seprates it into different cans

# This is the whole working principle of our project:)
