# This is an Arduino based wastage segretion system project, which
uses microcontroller(Arduino), sensors, ledd's, servo, etc. It basaically
detects the moisture of the waste and seprates biodegradable and non-
biodegradable waste on the basis of moisture presence

# It basically uses moisture sensor which detects the moisture presence 
in paticullar waste material and seprate it on the basis of wet and dry
waste. It detects the moisture and sends the data to microcontroller(Arduino),
the Arduino works according to the program and seprates the wastage, if the 
moisture is lower or equal to the value fixed in program, it will consider
the waste as biodegradable waste and if moisture is higher or equal to the 
value fixed in program, it will consider the waste as non - biodegradable
